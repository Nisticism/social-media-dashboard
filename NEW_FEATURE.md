## Description of added feature

Per the readme document, I should describe the new feature I created in a separate markdown document.

- The newly added feature allows users to expand the top cards (`LargeCards`) by clicking on them.
- Clicking reveals the `extra_data` parameter and the `url` set in `App.tsx`.
- The card transitions in 0.3s between its expanded and collapsed states when toggled.
- Might be a nice way to secondary or less important social media information to users.
- Url opens a new tab. This could be set specifically for the user by interpolating the username with the
  social media url. For now I left it just as the social media url because the usernames don't exist.

Thanks for reading the code, let me know if I can add anything else!
